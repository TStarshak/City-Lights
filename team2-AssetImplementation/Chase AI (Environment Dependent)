**Note- This script also requires you to create and modify settings in the [[Navigation]] Tab (Window->AI->Navigation)**
**Edit agent radius etc, bake the scene (determines walkable paths) and add it to the enemy itself (Add Component-->Nav Mesh Agent)**
**My current idea is to implement this in large clumps (to force kiting) or to place one or more of these enemies 
at a door to force the player to approach it, drag it away, and juke past it to exit an area**
**For now we will name this enemy doorKeep and  the player object Player**

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.AI;

public class Enemy : MonoBehviour
{

private NavMeshAgent doorKeep; //Calls the mesh agent that tells our enemy what paths are travesable
public GameObject Player;
public float activationDistance = 3.0f; //This distance determines how close you have to get to make the enemy chase after you

void Start()
{
doorKeep=GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>(); //applies the agent to our lovely enemy
}

void Update() //this all just tells the enemy to chase the player
{
float distance=Vector3.Distance(transform.position, Player.transform.position);

if (distance<activationDistance)
{
Vector3 dirToPlayer=transform.position-Player.transform.position;

Vector3 newPos=transform.position-dirToPlayer;

doorKeep.SetDestination(newPos);
}
}
}
